        <strong><i>“Sunset is so marvelous that even the sun itself watches it every day in the reflections of the infinite oceans!” – Mehmet Murat Ildan </i></strong>    
        <br>Oceans and Sunsets just seem to naturally go together. Sunsets are spectacular gifts to enjoy.  
        When you have the opportunity to watch a sunset over the ocean’s vastness, you stop and think – can it get any better?
        The sunset tells us that the day is almost over. 
        It reminds us of the importance of time and how we should use that time to its fullest. It’s also a time for reflection and dreaming.

            Dust or smoke in the atmosphere. Some nice fluffy clouds to catch the colours. 
            Big water with small waves to make a great reflection. A comfortable place to stand, sit or lie down to watch it. Good company. 
            A moment of quiet. But most importantly, a receptive and poetic attitude.
            Sunsets and oceans are therapy that are free to all of us. Is there anything more peaceful than taking in the quiet beauty of the 
            setting sun as it colors the immense ocean? Our oceans are a world of wonder and mystery, for a visit to the ocean can open 
            our mind and our heart to the great unknown.

            Do you feel the passion of the sunset? Perhaps you hear its music as it plays across the ocean. Can you picture a blaze of color—fiery oranges,
            brilliant yellows, pearly pinks, vibrant purples that decorate the ocean horizon? 
            The sunset tells us that the day is almost over.
            It reminds us of the importance of time and how we should use that time to its fullest. It’s also a time for reflection and dreaming.
            Now, as the sun descends into the ocean waters, creating romantic shades of red and orange across the sky, the world has a chance to breathe in and rejuvenate. 
            For sunsets are not only beautiful, but they also have so much significance.
            Indeed, they signify endings, change, and transformation; they remind us that change is part of life and everything has an ending.
